Scripts:
--------

 * release-bloom.py: generic python script that call -bloom osrf jenkins
   jobs.
 
 * ros_gazebo_pkgs-release.py.bash: bash script that will use release-bloom.py
   passing all the names of ros_gazebo_pkgs (gazebo-msgs, gazebo-ros, etc).

 * rename-gazeboX-ros-pkgs-release.sh: run on top of a ros_gazebo_pkgs-release
   repository, will change all the templates in bloom to set gazebo3 instead of
   just gazebo for renaming when releasing ROS wrappers.

 * git_clone_all_remote_branches.bash: script to clone all remote branches into 
   a local git repository. This is used when creating a new gazeboX_ros_pkg
   repository since github does not allow to host more than one fork of the 
   original gazebo_ros_pkgs repository.
